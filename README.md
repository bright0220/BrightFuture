BrightFutures
=============

BrightFutures is a simple Futures &amp; Promises library for iOS and OS X written in Swift. I wrote BrightFutures to learn Swift and hope that in the process, I've created a library that proves to be useful.

BrightFutures uses Control Flow-like syntax to wrap complicated calculations and provide an asynchronous interface to its result when it becomes available.

The goal of this project is to implement Scala's Future ([guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html), [api](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.concurrent.Future) in Swift.

## Compatibility
BrightFutures is compatible with Xcode 6 beta 3.

# Examples

## Control-flow syntax

```swift
let f = future { error in
  fibonacci(10)
}

f.onSuccess { value in
  // value will be 55
}
```

`error` is an inout parameter that can be set in the closure if the calculation failed. If `error` is non-nil after the execution of the closure, the future has failed. You can also hide the parameter if you don't need it:

```swift
let f = future { _ in
  fibonacci(10)
}
```

## Wrapping expressions in a Future
Using Swift's `@auto_closure` directive, BrightFutures provides a  simple way to wrap any expression into a Future.

```swift
future(fibonacci(10)).onSuccess { value in
    XCTAssert(value == 55)
}
```

This is great concise syntax if there is no need for a way to report a failure.

## The Promise of a Future value
```swift
func complicatedQuestion() -> Future<String> {
  let promise = Promise<String>()

  Queue.async {
  
    // do a complicated task
    
    promise.success("forty-two")
  }

  return promise.future
}
```

`Queue` is a simple wrapper around a dispatch queue.

## Chaining callbacks

Using the `andThen` function on a `Future`, the order of callbacks can be explicitly defined. The closure passed to `andThen` is meant to perform side-effects and does not influence the result. `andThen` returns a new Future with the same result as this future.


```swift
var answer = 10

let f = future(4)
let f1 = f.andThen { result in
    answer *= result.value!
}

let f2 = f1.andThen { result in
    answer += 2
}

// answer will be 42 (not 48)
```

`result` is an instance of `TaskResult`, which mimics a typical `Try` construct as much as the Swift compiler currently allows.

## Functional Composition

### map

`map` returns a new Future that contains the error from this Future if this Future failed, or the return value from the given closure that was applied to the value of this Future.

```swift
future { _ in
    fibonacci(10)
}.map { number in
    if number > 5 {
        return "large"
    }
    return "small"
}.map { sizeString in
    return sizeString == "large"
}.onSuccess { numberIsLarge in
    XCTAssert(numberIsLarge)
}
```

### zip

```swift
let f = future(1)
let f1 = future(2)

f.zip(f1).onSuccess { (let a, let b) in
    // a is 1, b is 2
}
```

## Recovering from errors
If a `Future` fails, use `recover` to offer a default or alternative value and continue the callback chain.

```swift
future { (inout error:NSError?) -> Int? in
    // fetch something from the web
    if (request.error) { // it could fail
        error = request.error
        return nil    
    }
}.recover { _ in // provide an offline default
    return 5
}.onSuccess { value in // either the request or the recovery succeeded
    XCTAssert(value == 5)
}
```

In addition to `recover`, `recoverWith` can be used to provide a Future that will provide the value to recover with.

## Custom execution contexts
By default, all tasks and callbacks are performed in a background queue. All future-wrapped tasks are performed concurrently, but all callbacks of a single future will be executed serially. You can however change this behavior by providing an execution context when creating a future or adding a callback:

```swift
let f = future(context: ImmediateExecutionContext()) { _ in
  fibonacci(10)
}

f.onComplete(context: QueueExecutionContext.main) { value in
  // update the UI, we're on the main thread
}
```

The calculation of the 10nth Fibonacci number is now performed on the same thread as where the future is created.

You can find more examples in the tests.

I really like Facebook's [BFTasks](https://github.com/BoltsFramework/Bolts-iOS), had a good look at the Promises & Futures implementation in [Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html) and also like what Max Howell is doing with [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit).
